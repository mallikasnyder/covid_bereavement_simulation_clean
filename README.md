# Code and data for reproducible results

This repository contains reproducible results for Snyder, Alburez-Gutierrez, Williams, and Zagheni (2022). "Estimates from 31 countries show the significant impact of COVID-19 excess mortality on the incidence of family bereavement". \textit{PNAS}. 

This repository contains the code required to run the simulations (the .\Rcode folder), as well as to obtain the estimates from this simulation outputs and to produce the figures and estimates referenced in the paper (the .\Kin_death folder). Both folders have their own README documents to explain the file structure and the steps needed to run the code that they contain. Other folders contain input data or store outputs generated by the code in these two main folders. It may be necessary to adjust the scripts slightly to reference files correctly, depending on the operating system and directory structure being used.  

The simulations used in the analysis are stored separately via the Harvard Dataverse. To calculate estimates from the simulation files, download the Harvard Dataverse files, adjust the directories as needed on your computer, and then run the estimation scripts. Note that both the simulations and the calculation of estimates used a multi-core server, and will likely not be possible to run on most laptops. 

Please contact Mallika Snyder (mallikasnyder@berkeley.edu) with any questions.
