# Code and data for reproducible results

This repository contains reproducible results for Snyder, Alburez-Gutierrez, Williams, and Zagheni (2022). "Estimates from 31 countries show the significant impact of COVID-19 excess mortality on the incidence of family bereavement". \textit{PNAS}. 

This repository contains the code required to obtain the estimates from this simulation outputs and to produce the figures and estimates referenced in the paper (the .\Kin_death folder). Other folders contain input data or store outputs generated by the code. Before running the scripts, ensure that you update the scripts to correctly reference the directories and file structure on your computer; this may depend on the operating system and directory structure being used.  

The simulations used in the analysis are stored separately via the Harvard Dataverse. To calculate estimates from the simulation files, download the Harvard Dataverse files (note that they are very large), adjust the directories as needed on your computer, and then run the estimation scripts. Note that the calculation of estimates used a multi-core server, and will likely not be possible to run on most laptops. 

Please contact Mallika Snyder (mallikasnyder@berkeley.edu) with any questions.
